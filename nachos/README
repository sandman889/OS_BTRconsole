Nachos Project: Team #6
	Tyler Sanders, Robin Bonatesta, Brendan Gray

	We chose to implement the third project option which is to build a command shell
within nachOS in order to execute a few commands relating to threads. 

Navigate into the BTRconsole folder, type make and then run nachOS and you will be on your way
